# Diamond-Price-Prediction

This project aims to predict diamond prices using various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and more. Accurate price predictions can help both buyers and sellers make informed decisions. Below is a summary of the project, including the process and results.

Objective :
To build a machine learning model that predicts the price of diamonds based on their characteristics.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle Diamonds dataset. It contains the following features:

Carat: The weight of the diamond
Cut: The quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
Color: The diamond color, from D (best) to J (worst)
Clarity: The clarity of the diamond (IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2)
Depth: Total depth percentage
Table: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point
Price: The price of the diamond (target variable)
x: Length in mm
y: Width in mm
z: Depth in mm
